## Introducing the Public Speaking Scrunchie!

The Micro:bit comes with many sensors and functionalities, but when I thought about the accelerometer's ability to detect movement, and the microphone's ability to detect sound, my brain went to public speaking and my time at Toastmasters International. 
 
If you've seen me around, I pretty much always have a scrunchie on my wrist. Since I'm often already wearing my scrunchie, I realized that it could also be a tool to make sure that I am making enough gestures and taking enough pauses throughout my speech! Introducing the Public Speaking Scrunchie prototype :).

## Tap the logo to start
Tap the gold logo (capacitive touch sensor) to start. From here, you'll see the word "start" flash across the Micro:Bit, using the LEDs. Get ready! You have five seconds to start your speech.

## Track your gestures
Every time the accelerometer detects an acceleration larger than 1400 mg, your gestures score is increased. This score will likely be in the hundreds and is easy to increase, making it beginner friendly, while still challenging experts who want a super high score.

## Track your pauses
When the sound level drops below 25 for at least 0.7 seconds, a pause is added to your score. The Micro:Bit will sum your pauses for you.

## Keep your arm still to get your score
As you finish your speech, maybe you are walking off the stage or just wrapping up a rehearsal. Either way, keep your arm still for ten seconds. The accelerometer detects a lack of movement, and you will hear a melody, indicating that it is time to check your microbit. You will see the following:

* gestures: first the word "gestures will flash across the Micro:Bit, indicating that the gestures score is about to be revealed.
* gestures value: your gestures score
* pauses: the word "pauses" then flashes across the Micro:Bit
* pauses value: your pauses score

## Try again!
Now you will see a happy face. If you want to do another speech, simply tap the gold logo to restart.
